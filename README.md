# Better Data Splits for Target Segments

The original release of `train.tsv`, `dev.tsv`, and `test.tsv` data splits for Common Voice's Target Segments corpus [[1](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)] had a bug, and they're not very useful as-is. Thankfully, it's easy to generate better data splits using the `CorporaCreator` tool [[2](https://github.com/mozilla/CorporaCreator)]!

This repo contains better data splits for this release of the Target Segments corpus. The Common Voice team already knows about the bug and will be re-packaging a release when they can (they've got a very full plate at the moment).

The data splits in this repo were generated by running the `CorporaCreator` over the `validated.tsv` file for each language, _with no cut-off for repeated sentences_ (this is key), and for convienience I'm hosting the new `train/dev/test` splits here.
